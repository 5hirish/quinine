## Reporting a Vulnerability

We value security for the project very highly. We encourage all users to report any vulnerabilities they discover to us.
If you find a security vulnerability in the Quinine project, please report it responsibly by raising an issue in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/5hirish/quinine/issues) with the "security" label.

We urge you to report any vulnerabilities responsibly
so that we can continue building a secure application for the entire community.
