⭐️ *An IDE for developers by developers* 🥂

## Why a new IDE?

IDEs have dated, heavy interfaces with high barriers to entry, focusing on code completion rather than rapid product development.
No-code tools lack customisation, limit performance, and lock users into proprietary ecosystems, making them unsuitable for scalable applications. 
We intend to build an open-source tool which is the best of both worlds: a low-code, low-barrier-to-entry IDE which focuses on productivity by simple drag-n-drop, plug-n-play interface while at the same time offering the control and freedom to build production-grade apps at scale.

## Features

![Quinine Early Concept](docs/tonic-concept.png "Quinine Early Concept")

> Drag-n-Drop the easy stuff, take control of the hard stuff. It combines the best aspects of IDEs and no-code tools, focusing on improving the developer experience and productivity without sacrificing power and control.

- 👋🏼  **Drag-n-Drop UI Designer** - A drag-and-drop UI designer with a suite of community-driven component library to empower you to focus on building beautiful interfaces, so you can focus on the performance and user experience.
- 🔌  **Plug-n-Play modules** - A community-driven plugin marketplace of utilities, SDKs like payment gateways, authentication, search, server-less services etc will free you from building such workflows from scratch and instead focus on fine-tuning for scale and performance.
- 🧠  **Smart Code Assists** - A suite of code assists to help you write code faster and more efficiently. Wrap any widgets from the component library, generate boilerplate code, and more.
- 🏎️  **Light-weight and Fast** - A light-weight and fast IDE that is built for speed and performance. No more waiting for your IDE to load. We aim to stay below 500MB of RAM usage.

## Key Tenets

- *Focus on developer experience and productivity*: The primary focus of Quinine IDE should be to improve the overall experience and productivity of developers using the platform.
- *Low-code, high flexibility*: The platform should offer a low-code environment that allows for flexibility and customization, while also providing powerful tools for those who want to dive into code.
- *Community-driven development*: Quinine IDE should foster a strong and vibrant community that contributes to the platform's growth and development.
- *Quality over quantity*: Prioritise quality over quantity when it comes to features, components, and plugins. Ensure that each addition to the platform meets a high standard of quality and usability.
- *Openness and transparency*: Foster an open and transparent development process that encourages participation and feedback from within the community.
- *Platform agnostic*: While the initial focus is on Flutter, the vision for Quinine IDE is to become platform agnostic with the aim of supporting other frameworks and languages in the future.
- *Innovation*: Quinine IDE should continually innovate and push the boundaries of what’s possible in low-code development, always keeping an eye on the latest trends and technologies.

## About

> Quinine is the core library that powers Tonic, a feature-rich low-code Flutter IDE designed to improve the development experience for Flutter developers. Quinine provides essential functionalities such as the low-code designer, syntax highlighting, autocompletion, error checking, and code navigation, making it the backbone of Tonic.

*Quinine gets its name from the natural compound quinine, which has been historically used as a key ingredient in tonic water. In the 19th century, quinine was discovered to have antimalarial properties and was extracted from the bark of the cinchona tree. British officials stationed in India mixed quinine with sugar and water to make it more palatable, creating the first tonic water. Later, it became popular to mix tonic water with gin, giving birth to the classic gin and tonic cocktail.*

*In a similar fashion, Quinine serves as the essential ingredient that gives Tonic its powerful capabilities. By integrating Quinine into Tonic, developers can enjoy a seamless and efficient coding experience when working with Flutter projects.*
