## Feature Specifications

Please delete this section if its a bug.

When adding a new feature and creating a pull request, it's important to describe the functionality and design decisions in detail.

1. **Functionality Description:** Describe the new functionality added. For instance, *"The markdown preview feature allows users to view the rendered output of their markdown file within the application. As the user edits their markdown file, the preview updates in real-time to reflect the changes."*

2. **User Interface:** Describe the UI changes that were made for this feature. Add links to prototype, design files or screenshots of similar feature in any other product. For example, *"A new Preview tab is added next to the Editor tab. The user can switch between the tabs to write and preview the markdown."*

3. **Implementation Details:** This could include the libraries or methods used to parse the markdown and render it. You may mention if you have added any new dependencies for this.

4. **Testing:** Describe the tests that have been written to ensure the functionality works as expected. This could include unit tests, widget tests, or integration tests.

5. **Performance Considerations:** If applicable, mention any impact on performance. *Such as render time for large markdown files.*

6. **Screenshots/GIFs:** Visual aids can be really helpful to reviewers to understand the new feature. If possible, add screenshots or GIFs that demonstrate the feature.

7. **Known Issues:** If there are any known issues or limitations with the feature, these should be clearly listed.
